# 🌱 Indoor IoT Air Quality Monitoring System

An IoT-based **robotic car system** designed for **indoor air quality monitoring** with real-time detection of hazardous gases.  
This project was developed during **Summer Research Internship Program (SRIP24), Qatar University**, and placed **2nd out of 82 projects**.

---

## 🏆 Highlights
- Designed and developed a robotic system capable of detecting **ammonia, CO₂, and NOx** in real time.
- Integrated **ESP32 microcontroller**, **MQ-135 gas sensor**, and **IP camera** with a **MATLAB GUI** for live monitoring and manual control.
- Implemented **Blynk platform notifications** to provide instant alerts of dangerous gas levels.
- Conducted a **systematic literature review (PRISMA method)** to guide sensor selection and system design.
- Ensured **high accuracy and reliability** through testing in diverse indoor environments.
